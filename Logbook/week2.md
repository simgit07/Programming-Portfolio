## Summary

This topic explains how variables are used in Python to store different kinds of data, such as numbers and text. Each value stored in a variable has a specific data type, like an integer, float, or string. The lesson also shows the different ways strings can be written using single, double, or triple quotation marks.

Built-in functions are introduced, including print(), which is used to display output, and input(), which allows users to enter information. It is important to understand that any value returned by input() is treated as a string. The topic also covers sequences in Python, focusing on strings and lists, and explains how their contents can be accessed using indexing and slicing. Finally, it highlights the key difference between them: strings cannot be changed after they are created, while lists can be modified as needed.
