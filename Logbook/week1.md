## Summary

This module introduces the basics of computer programming using Python. It explains what computer programs are and how they work by taking input, processing it, and producing output. The lecture also looks at how programming languages have evolved over time, from low-level machine code to more user-friendly high-level languages.

Python is used throughout the module because it is easy to learn, widely used, and suitable for both beginners and professionals. Students are introduced to different ways of writing and running Python programs, such as using the command-line interpreter and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The module also covers basic programming concepts like expressions, operators, and operator precedence. Finally, it discusses common programming errors and highlights the importance of reading error messages and debugging code as essential skills for any programmer.

## Key Technologies

Python – A beginner-friendly and widely used programming language

Python Interpreter – A tool that allows Python code to be written and run interactively

IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) – Software that helps programmers write, test, and debug code more easily

Compilers and Interpreters – Tools that translate or execute programming languages so computers can understand them

Assemblers – Software that converts assembly language into machine code

Python Libraries – Pre-written code that helps programmers perform tasks more quickly

Command Line Interface (CLI) – A text-based way to interact with the computer and run programs

Debugging Tools – Tools and error messages used to find and fix problems in programs
